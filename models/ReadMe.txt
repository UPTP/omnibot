Things to Note: Please use the github repository to share the models. 


Week tasks

Week 1) Modeling

For the mathematical modeling the omnidirectional wheeled mobile robot,we will defer to the method used in [1]. This part is already done but we will go through it again.

For the 3D model, we can use the ideas in [2]. [3] provides a more clear version of this approach. First we build the parts in a program such as blender then we will assemble it in webots. But the question is how should the final robot appear? 

The appearance of the robots upper body is not yet decided. However the robot's base and wheels are as they are important parts. The four wheel robot will be changable between 90 degrees and 45 degrees from the robot's body frame. I will draw diagrams on the github but refer to [1] and [3] for now. It is 45 degrees in [3].
